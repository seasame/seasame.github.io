            <h4 id="lets-get-some-perspective">Let&rsquo;s get some perspective</h4>
<p>We go through life and have a variety of experiences, and we read these experiences based on our likes/dislikes, our sense of good/bad, and whether is makes us feel pleasant/unpleasant. Let&rsquo;s call this our &ldquo;preferences&rdquo;. We see that our preferences have some default inclination, and that it evolves with time based on our experiences. For most people alive, they live and die following their preferences. If something happens which they consider good or pleasant, they feel happy. If something happens which they consider bad or unpleasant, they feel sad and unhappy. When the sadness persists for extended or repetitive periods of time, it leads to further disappointment, frustration; and in some cases, prolonged stress from experiences which we don&rsquo;t prefer cause us to have feelings of anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>On the flip side, when we experiences something &ldquo;good&rdquo;, we get a strong dose of confidence, we feel happy and love life. However, it never stays one way does it? We see-saw in these feelings as our experiences change. Some of us are resilient to these changes, whereas others dread them. Regardless, i think its fair to say that our &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo; of our experience is what rules our mood. <strong>If we are fortunate, at some point we observe, or maybe someone points it out to us; that we are just chasing after the needs and desires of our mind and body, and these desires have no end.</strong> We also observe that we chase after things which are momentary, change and die over time.</p>
<p>Everything that is living, dies; It&rsquo;s a universal truth, and changing/evolving, are steps towards the eventual death. Our desires evolve, our prespectives change, our environment changes, our bodies and mind change, the whole world is constantly changing. From a nihilistic perspective, being alive is a waste, we&rsquo;ll lose everything we gain, everything is meaningless and nothing really matters. <strong>Most of us, just choose to live in ignorance of this fact as, if we were to truly realize this, we&rsquo;ll just be depressed and not find any purpose in living.</strong></p>
<p>Yet, there&rsquo;s something within us which doesn&rsquo;t seem to change. Every cell in our body is now different than when we were a toddler, yet we somehow identify that &ldquo;I&rdquo; was a toddler once, and now &ldquo;I&rdquo; have grown up. What is this &ldquo;I&rdquo;. We can safely say it&rsquo;s not the body, as we know the body has changed. With some arguments, we can also perhaps agree that it is not the mind, for our minds have evolved and changed with time too. <strong>So there&rsquo;s something there, which we call &ldquo;I&rdquo; and that it is something apart from the mind and body.</strong></p>
<p>Thousands of years ago, in ancient India, philosophers have pondered about this entity, what it means to be alive, the purpose of existence, and how to interact with the universe. The recorded their thoughts as hymns which were spread through word of mouth and later in the written form. <strong>These records eventually became what we call the Vedas.</strong></p>
<h4 id="what-is-vedanta">What is Vedanta?</h4>
<p>The Vedas were classified into four main texts - Rig Veda, Sam Veda, Atharva Veda, and Yajur Veda. They contain a wealth of information about every subject, from nature, study of the human body, nature of the mind, the cosmos, medicine, history, geography, civics, economics etc; they seem to cover it all. I&rsquo;m not a vedic scholar nor am I a monk, so I won&rsquo;t claim any knowledge of the Vedas. We are hereto talk about Vedanta - so what is it? <strong>Vedanta literally means &ldquo;The essense of the Vedas&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p>Vedanta presents an investigation into what we are, and why we feel the way we feel or act the way we act. It presents to us the nature of existence and reality, and then it offers certain paths for us to realize that reality. And it promises, that realizing our true nature and that of reality will forever free us from sufferring. This amazing and ancient philosohy is thousands of years old and is viewed as the most complete understanding of life and nature. I&rsquo;ll discuss this topic from a personal perspective. I&rsquo;m just an regular person who has found these ideas to be valuable to bring peace, clarity and happiness in my life. I hope that reading this helps you as well.</p>
